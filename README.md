**Custom NPCs lists for the addon RareScanner for World of Warcraft**

You can [download](https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rarescanner) the RareScanner addon in Curseforge.

* [Here](https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rarescanner/pages/custom-npcs) you can find the instructions to import lists of custom NPCs in the addon RareScanner.

Available lists:
* **Alliance Enemy Elites.txt**: Contains outdoor elite NPCs for WoW Classic that will attack alliance players.
* **Horde Enemy Elites.txt**: Contains outdoor elite NPCs for WoW Classic that will attack horde players.

Important:
* Right now the game takes a while to paste long lists into the addon, so don't worry if the game freezes when you paste the list. Wait until it responds (I'm looking for a solution but in the meantime this is what we got).
* Once you click the button "Accept" and the addon starts importing the list, it can take up to 20-30 seconds to import the whole list, so **wait until the game starts moving fluently**.
